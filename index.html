                    <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/04/nes-classic-edition-review">"Nintendo's tiny retro console is a wonderful reminder that the great 8-bit classics will never die."</a>

                    <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/nintendo-classic-mini-nes">"These aren't the same as games from the days of early 3D graphics, when developers were still struggling to make use of the third-dimension, these are games from 2D-gaming's prime; NES developers knew what they were doing, and their efforts hold up surprisingly well over 30 years later."</a>

                    <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/04/nes-classic-edition-review">"The high-quality emulation from the NES Classic can stand toe-to-toe with much more expensive setups, like the Retron series of consoles."</a>
